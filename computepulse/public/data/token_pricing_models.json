A significant trend is the emergence of highly efficient, smaller models (e.g., GPT-4o mini, Claude 3 Haiku) at extremely low costs. Subscription models are solidifying as the primary consumer access method, while pay-per-token remains the standard for developers and enterprises, with increasing differentiation between self-hosted (like Meta's Llama) and API-based models."
