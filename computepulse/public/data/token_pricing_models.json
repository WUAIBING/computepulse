A new tier of highly efficient, smaller models (e.g., Claude 3 Haiku, Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash) is emerging at very low price points. Subscription models for individual consumers are converging around the $20/month price point, offering access to the latest models. Open-source options like Meta's Llama 3 continue to pressure the market, offering zero-cost model weights for self-hosting."
