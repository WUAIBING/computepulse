However, the integration of premier models into $20/month subscriptions (ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro) represents a major consumer pricing strategy with high growth, driven by the value of flagship models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.",

This is driven by intense competition and architectural improvements. Concurrently, a tiered pricing structure has solidified: highly efficient, smaller models (like Haiku, Gemini 1.5 Flash) are priced near-zero for high-volume tasks, while flagship models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) are offered at aggressive per-token prices and bundled into consumer subscriptions to drive mass adoption."
