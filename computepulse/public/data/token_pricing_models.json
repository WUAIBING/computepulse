    "trend": "The market is experiencing an aggressive price war and rapid increase in cost efficiency. Flagship models are becoming significantly cheaper (e.g., GPT-4o is 50% cheaper than GPT-4 Turbo), while new models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet offer top-tier performance at a lower cost. The $20/month subscription has become the standard for consumer access to premium models. Simultaneously, highly competitive low-cost options from Chinese labs (e.g., DeepSeek, Qwen) and powerful open-source models (Meta's Llama 3) are putting downward pressure on API pricing across the board."
