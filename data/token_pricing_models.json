    "trend": "The market is experiencing a price war, led by OpenAI's GPT-4o, which dramatically cut costs for top-tier models. This is driving down prices across the board. Subscription models have converged around a $20/month price point for premium consumer tiers (ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, Gemini Advanced, Copilot Pro). Simultaneously, new, highly efficient models from companies like DeepSeek and Qwen are offering competitive performance at a fraction of the cost, creating a new low-cost tier for price-sensitive applications. The open-source model economy (e.g., Meta's Llama 3) is also growing, with value shifting from model access to managed services and infrastructure from cloud providers."
